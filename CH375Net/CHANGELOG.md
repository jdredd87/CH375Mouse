# Changelog

CH375Net -- StevenC -- https://github.com/jdredd87/CH375USBTools

Versions live in the `VER` constant of each program. Nothing here has been
released; the project is in progress.

## Unreleased

### Working, and proven on the hardware

* **`AXPROBE` 0.2.0 brings an ASIX AX88179 (`0B95:1790`) all the way up**
  over a CH375: configuration set, PHY powered and out of reset, clocks
  selected, MAC read (`40:AE:30:6D:00:34`), receive path configured, link
  negotiated. First run, no debugging. `medium mode 0136` — 10 Mbps full
  duplex — and `rx control` reads back exactly the bits written.
* **`AXRECV` 0.1.0 reads real Ethernet off the wire.** A broadcast UDP
  frame from `192.168.50.8` and an IGMP query from the router both arrived
  and decode correctly by hand from the hex dump. Frames start at offset 0
  with no padding, which confirms `RX_CTL` `IP_ALIGN` being clear does what
  was intended.
* **`ax179.pas`** holds everything that knows what an AX88179 is, so the
  two programs and the eventual packet driver share one register map
  rather than three copies of it.
* The PHY is restricted to **10BASE-T** by default, by withdrawing the
  gigabit and 100 advertisements rather than by forcing the speed, so the
  far end negotiates normally. `/G` leaves it at gigabit. This is a runtime
  switch and not a constant because the arithmetic changes on a 486.
* Bulk-in aggregation is turned **off**, where Linux turns it on: this
  machine cannot absorb a 20 KB burst 64 bytes at a time. Also a 486
  decision waiting to be reversed.

### Two traps in the shared CH375 layer, found the hard way

* **`BusUp` never sends SET_CONFIGURATION.** A device with an address but
  no configuration is in Address state, where control transfers to endpoint
  0 work perfectly and every other endpoint does not exist. Every register
  access succeeded and the link came up; then all 7056 IN tokens to the
  bulk endpoint timed out in eight seconds. `AxInit` now sets the
  configuration first, taking the value from the descriptor rather than
  assuming 1.
* **`BusUp` sets `SET_RETRY 8F`, retry NAKs for ever.** Correct while
  enumerating, wrong for polling an idle endpoint: the chip retries instead
  of reporting, the caller's wait expires, and a poll takes seconds and
  returns "no interrupt". Two polls in nine seconds became 865 in under
  one. `AxInit` now sets no-retry after bring-up.

  `USBPOLL` already did both of these. Neither was documented anywhere but
  its source; both are now in this project's README.

* `AxRxBurst` drains and discards the remainder of a transfer that will not
  fit the caller's buffer, and reports how much went missing in
  `AxRxOver`. Leaving a transfer half-read desynchronises the endpoint and
  every burst after it is garbage -- which is what the first 2 KB buffer
  did before it was enlarged to 16 KB.
* Error reporting from the poll loop is capped at eight lines. An error
  that repeats every poll otherwise printed thousands of identical lines
  and the run spent all its time on output rather than on the wire.

### The receive buffer layout, solved and verified

    [frame 1][pad to 8][frame 2][pad to 8]...[entry 1][entry 2]...[trailer]

* trailer: last 4 bytes LE, low word = packet count, high word = offset of
  the entry array.
* entry: 4 bytes per packet, `(entry >> 16) and $1FFF` = frame length.
* frames: from offset 0, each padded to an 8-byte boundary. With IP_ALIGN
  clear there is no leading pad, so byte 0 is the destination MAC.

It matches what the Linux driver describes after all. Every earlier reading
that said otherwise was a truncated transfer, not a different format --
see the two bugs below. `AXRECV` checks each invariant and prints a tick or
a cross beside it rather than assuming any of them.

### Two more bugs, both mine, both in AxRxBurst

* **A NAK was being treated as the end of a transfer.** In USB a bulk
  transfer ends with a SHORT packet; a NAK part-way through only means "not
  ready yet, ask again". Every multi-frame transfer was being truncated --
  the capture that started this hunt stopped at 256 bytes with a second
  frame cut in half and no trailer in it at all. Mid-burst NAKs are now
  retried, bounded, and only a short packet ends a burst.
* **Zeroing `AX_RX_BULK_QCTRL` does not mean "no aggregation".** It means
  *no limit*, which is the opposite: the chip appends frames for as long as
  traffic arrives and the transfer never ends. One capture reached 55,680
  bytes before the buffer gave up. The control byte is now 07 -- all three
  limits on -- with the size, timer and inter-frame gap exposed as
  `AxBulkCtrl` / `AxBulkSize` / `AxBulkTimer` / `AxBulkIfg` and reachable
  from `AXRECV` as `/C=` and `/B=`.

### Throughput, measured

* About **1650 bytes/sec** sustained with the link deliberately loaded --
  roughly 13 kbit/s.
* In a 15-second run: **12,112 idle polls against ~390 reads carrying
  data**. The limit is not how fast bytes leave the CH375, it is that the
  chip has something for us on about 3% of polls. Raw read bandwidth looks
  nearer 50 KB/s if the duty cycle could be improved.
* Burst size does not behave the way you would guess: `/B=02` gives
  1650 B/s and `/B=08` gives **302 B/s**, five times worse, because a
  bigger threshold makes the chip wait longer and drop more while waiting.
  The default is 2 for that measured reason rather than a guessed one.

### Not done

* **Transmit.** Each frame needs an 8-byte header; none is sent yet.
* **The packet driver.** A Crynwr driver at INT 60h, so `mTCP` and
  `WATTCP` work without a TCP stack being written here.
* **A duty-cycle fix.** 3% of polls carrying data is the thing standing
  between 1.6 KB/s and something nearer 50 KB/s, and it is a tuning
  problem rather than a bus-speed one.
